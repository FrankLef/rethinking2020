    "text": "All models and computations use the brms package (Bürkner 2021). It is inspired from Solomon Kurtz who did wonderful work. It is all detailed at Solomon Kurtz.\nThis is important as, rethinking R-rethinking is not used in real-life applications whereas brms is considered a reference.\nThe loo package Vehtari et al. (2022) is used by both rethinking and brms to compute WAIC and LOO. See chapter 7 Ulysses’ compass, section 7.5, for details."

    "text": "1.2 Using tidyverse\nA fundamental role of this study project is, in addition to learning Bayesian statistics, to learn how to use a tool kit which is inseparable from the study of Bayesian stats. Therefore the tidyverse paradigm is used given it’s very elaborate and more ergonomic set of tools.\n\n1.2.1 tidybayes, ggdist, distributional and extraDistr\nThe ggdist (Kay 2022) and tidybayes (Kay 2020) packages are the work horses of this book. tidybayes relies heavily on the ggdist and reexport very many of it’s functions. In addition ggdist is useful for both a frequencist as well as a bayesian approach.\nAs a resultggdist will be the first choice, tidybayes will be used when the task is better done with it, in particular for its ability to do the data with brms\nThe distributional package (O’Hara-Wild, Kay, and Hayes 2022) is used with stat_dist_ functions in ggdist to create slab+interval geoms for analytical distributions.\nThe extraDistr package (Wolodzko 2020) has many extra distributions such as BetaBinom, NegBetaBinom, HalfCauchy, ZIP, Pareto, etc. which are useful in real-world applications and usually dispersed amongst many different packages.\n\n\n1.2.2 bayesplot and bayestestR\nbayesplot (Gabry and Mahr 2021) and bayestestR (Makowski et al. 2021) are used as complement when ggdist and tidybayes do not provide a satisfactory solution.\n\n\n1.2.3 Using ggplot2, scales and paletteer\nThe ggplot2 package (Wickham 2016) has become the standard for ploting in R, no question. There are 2 packages that really help in making plots with ggplot: scales and paletteer\nThe scales (Wickham and Seidel 2022) has a whole slew of functions to manage scales for visualization.\nThe paletteer (Hvitfeldt 2021) is a very nice package to manage color and shape palettes.\n\n\n1.2.4 Using knitr\nThe knitr package (Xie 2022) was used for rmd documents whereas this project uses the new quarto standard. Still, some functions from knitr can be useful and still such as the one to create bibliography.\n\n# to write references, use this command\nknitr::write_bib(c(\"knitr\"), width = 80)\n\n\n\n\n\nBürkner, Paul-Christian. 2021.
